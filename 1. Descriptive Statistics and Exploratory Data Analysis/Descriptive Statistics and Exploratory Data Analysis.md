# Types of Descriptive Statistics

**Frequency distribution**, which tells you how frequently (i.e. how many times) a certain value occurs within your dataset.


**Measures of central tendency**, which estimate the middle or average values within your dataset. Measures of central tendency are the **mean, median, and mode.**


**Measures of variability** help you gauge how much variability or “spread” there is within your dataset; in other words, how spread out the values are. Measures of variability are **range, standard deviation, and variance**.
